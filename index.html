            <h1>An introduction</h1>
            <br>
            <p>C++ is a great programming language, as it is universal, therefore it is useful in everything from web development and cloud solutions, to desktop apps, game development
            , data science, and everything in between. In addition, despite the ever-changing computer science industry constantly in need for new changes, C++ has remained an industry
            standard ever since it's mainstream introduction and usage; thus, this is why this website is teaching you C++. Before we get started, you may want to learn about some
            tools of the trade and some prerequisites to learning how to code. First, in order to edit code since you are not going to be creating enterprise level code yet, simply
            stick with <a href="http://cpp.sh/" target="_blank">this</a> website. P.S: Click the underlined text to go to it. I will explain how to use it later. Second of all, this website is teaching C++, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
            Now let us begin.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="content">
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
            <br>
<pre>
<code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!\n";

    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
</code>
</pre>
            <p>Take a look at the above code. Try to understand what is does, and what each line means. Don't understand? Don't worry, because you will in just a second. Ok, get
            ready, because this will be a lot to take in. First of all, the line at the very top of the page tells the computer to use a certain bit of code that has been already
            written before to make things easier. C++ uses a system of including and well, not including those bits of pre-written code. For example, lets say little Timmy wants to
            make a simple program that tells the user that Timmy is hungry. Instead of writing 50 lines of code to simply say "I am hungry", Timmy simply tells the computer to include
            all of the code that has been written before in his program. Now, Timmy simply can just tell the feed what he wants the computer to say into that pre-written code he just
            included all in 2 lines of code. Note that the code says #include &lt;iostream&gt;. That means that is is including the code called "iostream". Programmers call those bits
            of code "headers", so keep that in mind when I call them headers in the future. Anyways, iostream means input output stream. Iostream is the header that helps people make a
            computer say whatever they want it to say, however it also comes with input, allowing the programmer to recieve input from the user of their application. Now take a look at
            the 4th line. The following should be what you're focusin on: int main() {. Lets break that down as well. That line of code is telling the computer that everything between
            that curly bracket and the second one is to be ran as soon as the program is run. Everything outside of those curly brackets are either telling the computer addition info
            beforehand, or are to either be executed as a seperate process, running alongside the main code. In some cases, things outside those curly brackets are simply bits and pieces
            of code waiting to be ran. That was simple. Now for the the next, and final line we will discuss as of right now. The cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!\n"; line. That line makes
            use of that code from iostream we were talking about earlier. It essentially makes the computer say the phrase, "Hello World!". That's it. the "cout" you see in there means,
            output whatever is in those quotation marks. Then, the semi-colon at the end signals that that was the end of that statement, nothing else related to that piece of code should
            be done, and the computer moves on to the next line, executing the line until it gets to the semi-colon, and so on and so forth. Great, now you should understand what some of
            that code. Now, we will try to really understand how to take input and output.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="content">
            <h1>Input and output explained (Well, just output explained)</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Remember cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!\n"; from earlier? Now we will dig deeper into it. Firstly, we never talked about those forbidden less than symbols. Now we will.
            Those symbols are there to tell the computer which direction data is traveling. In this case, Hello World!\n is our data, and those less than symbols are telling the data
            to go to the command cout. Cout now takes the data it recieved, and outputs it. That is why it is called cout, because cout means "c out", and out means output. Now,
            when you want your program to output something, always use the just discussed method, and obviously, replace Hello World!\n with what you want it to say. Now, with your
            newlyfound knowledge, go to the website mentioned at the introduction, delete the code you see there already and type in the example code seen above in that grey box.
            When you are done, click the blue button that says "Run", and do not click anything else. Once the program finishes running, practice changing what the computer says by
            changing what's within those quotation marks, and try re-wrting the example code without looking at this website, until you remember how to write it very well. Note that
            when you want to make changes to the code, just make your changes and press the run button again, no need to do anything else.</p>

            <h1>Data types and variables</h1>
            <br> 
            <p>Data types are a quite essential, yet simple concept to learn. There a few main datatypes:
				<ul>
					<li>Integers. Integers are typically reffered to as their shorter name, "int". An integer is what you think it is, an integer. Basically, it is either negative or positive, and it is always going to be a whole number.
					Attempting to add a decimal will throw and exception (error). Integers are more efficient than floats from a memory access speed and memory usage standpoint. Thus, it is good practice to avoid using a float unnecessarily.
					</li>
					<li>Floats. A float is just like an integer, just it doesn't have the same rules. A float can store a decimal unlike integers. Not much more can be said about floats.
					</li>
					<li>Double floating point. A double is a double precision version of the floating point variable. Although double percision means more digits in the decimal, that also means less efficient use of memory, which in a pinch or in larger
					usages, can be a bad thing for things such as games, 3D software, or RAM intensive applications. A double is not usually useful as floats already offer an entire 4 byte limit.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			Another thing to take into consideration is a datatype modifier. A datatype modifier is something that modifies the length of a piece of data. The main datatype modifiers you will encounter are longs, shorts, signed, and unsigned.
			These datatype modifiers can be applied to any datatype. A long can be applied to a piece of data to lengthen the limit of that piece of data. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, data has a limit. Even for temporary data. In some cases,
			when a variable is overloaded with digits, it will either throw an exception, or continue to work, yet silently, it will round everything to the nearest whole number for example, in the case of the floating point and double floating point
			datatypes. A short  does the opposite of a long, and an unsigned variable may not caontain a negative, whereas a signed variable may.
			A last few words in this giant wall of text that this site is, will be about what a variable is. A variable is simply some data stored on the machine of the end user temporarily, that will change on demand when requested to do so, and can be
			accessed, read, or written to by software very quickly, at the cost of a lack of storage space and permanance. Each variable will be removed and cleared after each session. This means, if the user closes the application or reboots
			their machine, the data will be gone no matter what.

        <h1>If, else, and loops.</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Conditional statements and loops are like the bread and butter of C++. They are vital for a functional program in C++. A conditional statement can execute block of code under any condition. For example, what if you wanted a    program to only play a sound when a timer has reached zero? You could use conditional statements. You could tell the computer, if the variable called timer has reached 0 or below that, play a sound. Take a look at the following code. That is how a conditional statement is formatted. The if tells the computer it is a conditional statement. Next, what's in the brackets is the condition. That is what the computer is waiting for so it can execute the code. Next, the curly braces denote where to code that will be executed is. Conditional statments are pretty simple. Now to look at some loops. One of the simpler loops is called the while loop. It is just like an if statement, but with a loop built-in. It is formatted the same way as a conditional statement, however, instead of if, you put while, and the code executed by a while loop will continue executing repeatedly until the condition in the parentheses is no longer true.</p>

<code>
if (x == 0) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!\n";
}

        <h1>Operators</h1>
        <p>Operators are an integeral part of C++, as they can perform many operations such as math that are important. One of the useful operators is simply a plus sign. The plus sign operator does the obvious, it performs addition. Another operator is the opposite which is the minus sign, which, well does the opposite of the plus sign. For multiplication it is the asterik, or as some people call it, the star. The division operator is a slash. Specifically the forward slash. To increment or decrement something, rather than using the addition or subtraction operator, to save development time you can use the operators built for that purpose know as the increment and decrement operator. The increment operator is simply two plus signs, and for the decrement operator is is two minus signs. Some examples of these operators in use:</p>
        <br>
        <p>The addition operator:</p>
        <pre>
<code>
int x = 100 + 50;
</code>
</pre>
<br>
        <p>The increment operator:</p>
        <pre>
<code>
int x = 0;
x++
</code>
